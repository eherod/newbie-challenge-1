### What I learned

I've been focused on server side coding for the past month, so this was a nice project to get my mind back on the front end. My main focus while working on this was to lock in my understanding of how to work with background images. In the past I have just messed with the positioning until I got something to work, but I really didn't know what I was doing. I was much more intentional with this project. I learned how to make an overlay too.

I also had not worked with media queries for a while, so this was a nice refresher.


### Continued development

I have a much better grasp on how to control my background images. I now have some questions about using the img tag, specifically about how to put an overlay on an image when you use the img tag rather than a background image. I am considering rebuilding this project again and replacing the background image with an image inserted using the img tag.



### Useful resources

- CSS The Missing Manual 4th edition -  This is a nice reference to use when I forget how to do something or want to expand my understaning. It really helped with the background images.

- Kevin Powell on youtube(https://www.youtube.com/user/KepowOb) - Master css instructor. I frequent this channel quite often. It is usually the first place I go with css related questions.
